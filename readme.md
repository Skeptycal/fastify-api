## This is part of my Personal Portfolio at [skeptycal.com](http://www.skeptycal.com)

> I am creative and I love coding. My personal portfolio is intended to be a tour of the variety of skillsets and interests that I have using a mix of technologies, including:

## Python

> Python is my main training focus now. Some Django, Grabbing and Parsing data, Visuzalizations, Algorithm comparisons, Efficiency comparisons, Automated tasks, Fun, and games

## Data visualizations

> matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot, pygal, Plotly, geoplotlib, Gleam, missingno, Leather, D3, Bokeh, and some creations of my own ...

## PHP

> educational portal website, tech support and training website, authentication setup

## Front end comparisons

> between Angular, React, my own, whatever I can think of.

## A little bit of this and that ....

> R, CSS/html, JS, TS, C++, Go, and a smattering of more esoteric languages ...

## Node.js

> I'm new to this, but really liking it ... several experiments with bots ... this is the language I am least familiar with, so it will get interesting

## Apple stuff I'm behind on

> Swift for iOS and MacOS ... I started several projects last year and need to get back to them

## Fortran

> I'm setting up some older college calculus, chemistry, and statistics programs. Most likely I will compare these to the C++, PHP, and Python implementations just out of curiosity.

## Pascal

> (because, why not at this point ...)
